abstract: Disease-specific online health communities provide a convenient and common
  platform for patients to share experiences, change information, provide and receive
  social support. This study aimed to compare differences between online psychological
  and physiological disease communities in topics, sentiment, participation, and emotional
  contagion patterns using multiple methods as well as to discuss how to satisfy the
  users’ different informational and emotional needs. We chose the online depression
  and diabetes communities on the Baidu Tieba platform as the data source. Topic modeling
  and theme coding were employed to analyze discussion preferences for various topic
  categories. Sentiment analysis was used to identify the sentiment polarity of each
  post and comment. The social network was used to represent the users’ interaction
  and emotional flows to discover the differences in participation and emotional contagion
  patterns between psychological and physiological disease communities. The results
  revealed that people affected by depression focused more on their symptoms and social
  relationships, while people affected by diabetes were more likely to discuss treatment
  and self-management behavior. In the depression community, there were obvious interveners
  spreading positive emotions and more core users in the negative emotional contagion
  network. In the diabetes community, emotional contagion was less prevalent and core
  users in positive and negative emotional contagion networks were basically the same.
  The study reveals insights into the differences between online psychological and
  physiological disease communities, providing a greater understanding of the users’
  informational and emotional needs expressed online. These results are helpful for
  society to provide actual medical assistance and deploy health interventions based
  on disease types.
