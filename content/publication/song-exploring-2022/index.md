abstract: 'Background: This study aimed to analyze the landscape of publications on
  bariatric metabolic surgery through machine learning and help experts and scholars
  from various disciplines better understand bariatric metabolic surgery’s hot topics
  and trends.   Methods: In January 2021, publications indexed in PubMed under the
  Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) term ‘Bariatric Surgery’ from 1946 to 2020 were
  downloaded. Python was used to extract publication dates, abstracts, and research
  topics from the metadata of publications for bibliometric evaluation. Descriptive
  statistical analysis, social network analysis (SNA), and topic modeling with latent
  Dirichlet allocation (LDA) were used to reveal bariatric metabolic surgery publication
  growth trends, landscape, and research topics.   Results: A total of 21,798 records
  of bariatric metabolic surgery–related literature data were collected from PubMed.
  The number of publications indexed to bariatric metabolic surgery had expanded rapidly.
  Obesity Surgery and Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases are currently the most
  published journals in bariatric metabolic surgery. The bariatric metabolic surgery
  research mainly included five topics: bariatric surgery intervention, clinical case
  management, basic research, body contour, and surgical risk study.   Conclusion:
  Despite a rapid increase in bariatric metabolic surgery–related publications, few
  studies were still on quality of life, psychological status, and long-term follow-up.
  In addition, basic research has gradually increased, but the mechanism of bariatric
  metabolic surgery remains to be further studied. It is predicted that the above
  research fields may become potential hot topics in the future.'
