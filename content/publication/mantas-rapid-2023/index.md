abstract: The proliferation of health misinformation in recent years has prompted
  the development of various methods for detecting and combatting this issue. This
  review aims to provide an overview of the implementation strategies and characteristics
  of publicly available datasets that can be used for health misinformation detection.
  Since 2020, a large number of such datasets have emerged, half of which are focused
  on COVID-19. Most of the datasets are based on fact-checkable websites, while only
  a few are annotated by experts. Furthermore, some datasets provide additional information
  such as social engagement and explanations, which can be utilized to study the spread
  of misinformation. Overall, these datasets offer a valuable resource for researchers
  working to combat the spread and consequences of health misinformation.
