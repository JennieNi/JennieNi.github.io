	abstract = {This study aims to evaluate the performance of LLMs with various prompt engineering strategies in the context of health fact-checking.,Inspired by Dual Process Theory, we introduce two kinds of prompts: Conclusion-first (System 1) and Explanation-first (System 2), and their respective retrieval-augmented variations. We evaluate the performance of these prompts across accuracy, argument elements, common errors and cost-effectiveness. Our study, conducted on two public health fact-checking datasets, categorized 10,212 claims as knowledge, anecdotes and news. To further analyze the reasoning process of LLM, we delve into the argument elements of health fact-checking generated by different prompts, revealing their tendencies in using evidence and contextual qualifiers. We conducted content analysis to identify and compare the common errors across various prompts.,Results indicate that the Conclusion-first prompt performs well in knowledge (89.70\%,66.09\%), anecdote (79.49\%,79.99\%) and news (85.61\%,85.95\%) claims even without retrieval augmentation, proving to be cost-effective. In contrast, the Explanation-first prompt often classifies claims as unknown. However, it significantly boosts accuracy for news claims (87.53\%,88.60\%) and anecdote claims (87.28\%,90.62\%) with retrieval augmentation. The Explanation-first prompt is more focused on context specificity and user intent understanding during health fact-checking, showing high potential with retrieval augmentation. Additionally, retrieval-augmented LLMs concentrate more on evidence and context, highlighting the importance of the relevance and safety of retrieved content.,This study offers insights into how a balanced integration could enhance the overall performance of LLMs in critical applications, paving the way for future research on optimizing LLMs for complex cognitive tasks.,The peer review history for this article is available at: https://publons.com/publon/10.1108/OIR-02-2024-0111},

This study aimed to compare differences between online psychological and physiological disease communities in topics, sentiment, participation, and emotional contagion patterns using multiple methods as well as to discuss how to satisfy the users’ different informational and emotional needs. We chose the online depression and diabetes communities on the Baidu Tieba platform as the data source. Topic modeling and theme coding were employed to analyze discussion preferences for various topic categories. Sentiment analysis was used to identify the sentiment polarity of each post and comment. The social network was used to represent the users’ interaction and emotional flows to discover the differences in participation and emotional contagion patterns between psychological and physiological disease communities. The results revealed that people affected by depression focused more on their symptoms and social relationships, while people affected by diabetes were more likely to discuss treatment and self-management behavior. In the depression community, there were obvious interveners spreading positive emotions and more core users in the negative emotional contagion network. In the diabetes community, emotional contagion was less prevalent and core users in positive and negative emotional contagion networks were basically the same. The study reveals insights into the differences between online psychological and physiological disease communities, providing a greater understanding of the users’ informational and emotional needs expressed online. These results are helpful for society to provide actual medical assistance and deploy health interventions based on disease types.},

	abstract = {Designing persuasive debunking messages poses significant challenges in addressing rumors during public health crises, especially when confronting diverse informational backgrounds. However, the underlying mechanisms through which the congruence between debunking messages and background information influences their persuasiveness remains unclear. Therefore, drawing upon the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) of persuasion theory, this study develops a theoretical model to explore how topic congruence and reputation congruence moderate the relationships between cognitive and affective appeals and debunking message persuasiveness. We collected 18,825 COVID-19 debunking posts and associated data from Sina Weibo. Employing linguistic psychoanalysis, machine learning algorithms, and econometric analysis, we operationalize key variables and subject our model to rigorous testing. The results indicated that cognitive appeals, including argument adequacy (β = 0.040, p {\textless} 0.01), evidence quality (β = 0.163, p {\textless} 0.01), expression certainty (β = 0.048, p {\textless} 0.01), media richness (β = 0.264, p {\textless} 0.01), and source credibility (β = 0.138, p {\textless} 0.01), as well as affective appeals, encompassing emotional pleasure (β = -0.020, p {\textless} 0.01), emotional arousal (β = 0.033, p {\textless} 0.01), and emotional dominance (β = 0.015, p {\textless} 0.01) significantly influenced debunking message persuasiveness through the central and peripheral cues of ELM, respectively. Moreover, topic congruence and reputation congruence exhibited differing moderating effects. Specifically, topic congruence amplified the impacts of cognitive appeals while weakening that of affective appeals on debunking message persuasiveness. Conversely, reputation congruence yielded inverse effects on the two types of appeals. These findings furnish invaluable insights for government authorities and social media platforms in comprehending the intricate mechanisms underlying debunking message persuasiveness, thereby facilitating the development of more persuasive strategies to counter rumors in public health emergencies.},

	abstract = {Background:
              This study aimed to analyze the landscape of publications on bariatric metabolic surgery through machine learning and help experts and scholars from various disciplines better understand bariatric metabolic surgery’s hot topics and trends.
            
            
              Methods:
              In January 2021, publications indexed in PubMed under the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) term ‘Bariatric Surgery’ from 1946 to 2020 were downloaded. Python was used to extract publication dates, abstracts, and research topics from the metadata of publications for bibliometric evaluation. Descriptive statistical analysis, social network analysis (SNA), and topic modeling with latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) were used to reveal bariatric metabolic surgery publication growth trends, landscape, and research topics.
            
            
              Results:
              A total of 21,798 records of bariatric metabolic surgery–related literature data were collected from PubMed. The number of publications indexed to bariatric metabolic surgery had expanded rapidly. Obesity Surgery and Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases are currently the most published journals in bariatric metabolic surgery. The bariatric metabolic surgery research mainly included five topics: bariatric surgery intervention, clinical case management, basic research, body contour, and surgical risk study.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              Despite a rapid increase in bariatric metabolic surgery–related publications, few studies were still on quality of life, psychological status, and long-term follow-up. In addition, basic research has gradually increased, but the mechanism of bariatric metabolic surgery remains to be further studied. It is predicted that the above research fields may become potential hot topics in the future.},
